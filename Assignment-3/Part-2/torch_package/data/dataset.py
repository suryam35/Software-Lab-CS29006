            return the dataset element for the index: "idx"
            Arguments:
                idx: index of the data element.

            Returns: A dictionary with:
                image: image (in the form of a numpy array) (shape: (3, H, W))
                gt_bboxes: N X 5 array where N is the number of bounding boxes, each 
                            consisting of [class, x1, y1, x2, y2]
                            x1 and x2 lie between 0 and width of the image,
                            y1 and y2 lie between 0 and height of the image.

            You need to do the following, 
            1. Extract the correct annotation using the idx provided.
            2. Read the image and convert it into a numpy array (wont be necessary
                with some libraries). The shape of the array would be (3, H, W).
            3. Scale the values in the array to be with [0, 1].
            4. Create a dictonary with both the image and annotations
            4. Perform the desired transformations.
            5. Return the transformed image and annotations as specified.
